A simple guitar GUI

The top 6 rows reference the open strings and first 5 frets of a guitar neck.
The 7th row stores the last note played on the appropriate string.
Pressing a chord loads a note onto each of the 6 strings. When "Strum Instantly" is checked, the chords will play immediately.
The strum button will play all 6 strings and the notes loaded on each.

Press the buttons to play the associated sounds.
